# Ridge-Regression
It is popular Regularization Technique
>Learns weights and bias using Ordinary Least Sqaure criterion but adds a penalty for large variations in W parameters.
>Once the parameters are learned, the Ridge Regression prediction formula is the same as ordinary least sqaures.

This Regression technique is used to create parsimonious models with large number of features. Usually used in two scenarios
- When number of predictor variables exceeds number of observations.
- When there is correlation between predictor variables (Multicollinearity)
